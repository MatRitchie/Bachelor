 at six for some reason when i go to the app   the comedy of man starts like this: our brains are way too big for our mothers hips and so nature she devised this alternative: we emerge halfformed and hope whoever greets us on the other end is kind enough to fill us in and babies thats pretty much how its been ever since now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address like say that half of us are periodically iron deficient so somebodys gotta go kill something while i look after the kids id do it myself but what are you gonna to get this thing its milk he says as soon as he gets back from the hunt we can switch its hard not to fall in love with something so helpless ladies i hope we dont end up regretting this   comedy now thats what i call pure comedy just wait until the part where they start to believe theyre at the center of everything and some allpowerful being endowed this horror show with meaning   oh their religions are the best they worship themselves yet theyre totally obsessed with risen zombies celestial virgins magic tricks these unbelievable outfits and they get terribly upset when you question their sacred texts written by womanhating epileptics their languages just serve to confuse them their confusion somehow makes them more sure they build fortunes poisoning their offspring and hand out prizes when someone patents the cure where did they find these goons they elected to rule them what makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable these mammals are hellbent on fashioning new gods so they can go on being godless animals     oh comedy their illusions they have no choice but to believe their horizons that just forever recede and hows this for irony: their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs that they never ever have to leave oh comedy oh its like something that a madman would conceive the only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive but the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with until theres nothing human left   just random matter suspended in the dark i hate to say it but each others all weve got,pure comedy

 there are times that walk from you like some passing afternoon summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon and she chose a yard to burn but the ground remembers her wooden spoons her children stir her bougainvillea blooms   there are things that drift away like our endless numbered days autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made and shes chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves   there are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass springtime calls her children til she lets them go at last and shes chosen where to be though shes lost her wedding ring somewhere near her misplaced jar of bougainvillea seeds   there are things we cant recall blind as night that finds us all winter tucks her children in her fragile china dolls but my hands remember hers rolling round the shaded ferns naked arms her secrets still like songs id never learned   there are names across the sea only now i do believe sometimes with the windows closed shell sit and think of me but shell mend his tattered clothes and theyll kiss as if they know a baby sleeps in all our bones so scared to be alone,passing afternoon

ribbon of the river by my side i walk the shores and watch it unwind the railway tracks will leave a glimpse of the light from the train trailing sparks of gold behind  and as soon as youre seen it its gone as soon as youve seen it its gone  secrets of the city make an aching in my heart and the mysteries that tease me so i long to belong but i always have to go  people stare and wonder why i stray they dont understand that wanderings my way ill never stop though time is slipping away the elusive light shining strange on my face  as soon as youve seen it its gone as soon as youve seen it its gone  secrets of the city make an aching in my heart and the mysteries that tease me so i long to belong but i always have to go  home ties me up with discontent since the day i first went yearning to be back again how will i return and when  secrets of the city make an aching in my heart and the mysteries that tease me so i long to belong but i always have to go,ribbon
 please remember me happily by the rosebush laughing with bruises on my chin the time when we counted every black car passing your house beneath the hill and up until someone caught us in the kitchen with maps a mountain range a piggy bank a vision too removed to mention   but please remember me fondly i heard from someone youre still pretty and then they went on to say that the pearly gates had some eloquent graffiti like well meet again and fuck the man and tell my mother not to worry and angels with their great handshakes were always done in such a hurry   and please remember me that halloween making fools of all the neighbors our faces painted white by midnight wed forgotten one another and when the morning came i was ashamed only now it seems so silly that season left the world and then returned and now youre lit up by the city   so please remember me mistakenly in the window of the tallest tower calling passersby but much too high to see the empty road at happy hour gleam and resonate just like the gates around the holy kingdom with words like lost and found and dont look down and someone save temptation   and please remember me as in the dream we had as rugburned babies among the fallen trees and fast asleep beside the lions and the ladies that called you what you like and even might give a gift for your behavior a fleeting chance to see a trapeze swinger high as any savior   but please remember me my misery and how it lost me all i wanted those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains the colored birds above their running in circles around the well and where it spells on the wall behind st peter so bright on cinder gray in spray paint who the hell can see forever   and please remember me seldomly in the car behind the carnival my hand between your knees you turned from me and said the trapeze act was wonderful but never meant to last the clown that passed saw me just come up with anger when it filled with circus dogs the parking lot had an element of danger   so please remember me finally and all my uphill clawing my dear but if i make the pearly gates ill do my best to make a drawing of god and lucifer a boy and girl an angel kissing on a sinner a monkey and a man a marching band all around a frightened trapeze swinger,the trapeze swinger

“what has been is what will be and what has been done is what will be done and there is nothing new under the sun  is there a thing of which it is said ‘see this is new it has been already in the ages before us  there is no remembrance of former things nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after”  ecclesiastes  pure comedy is the story of a species born with a halfformed brain the species only hope for survival ﬁnding itself on a cruel unpredictable rock surrounded by other species who seem far more adept at this whole thing and to whom they are delicious is the reliance on other slightly older halfformed brains this reliance takes on a few different names as their story unfolds like “love” “culture” “family” etc over time and as their brains prove to be remarkably good at inventing meaning where there is none the species becomes the purveyor of increasingly bizarre and sophisticated ironies these ironies are designed to help cope with the species loathsome vulnerability and to try and reconcile how disproportionate their imagination is to the monotony of their existence  now all of a sudden they expect light in the dark warmth in the cold and to make something out of nothing cooperation among the species to achieve these goals eventually yields a worldview wherein some among the species believe that there are individuals for whom this type of work is maybe illsuited the contribution of the illsuited is of a more abstract inspirational nature the illsuited begin to make subtle distinctions among themselves that extend beyond “eaten by a bearnot eaten by a bear” these distinctions involve doitness coolfaceandbodyness craftiness etc – an arrangement emerges where these traits can be traded in for betterthanness this betterthanness really starts to run rampant and the species begins to wonder if there isnt a skyman in the sky who is perhaps the source of all betterthanness it seems like a pretty good explanation for why the species is so important  skyman pretty much runs the show for a really really long time and his innercircle of betterthans gets increasingly smaller and smaller even though by the end of his reign everyone in the species considers themselves one unfortunately there are some betterthans who get together and decide that one way of betterthanness is better than other bettersthans betterthanness and teach their little halfformedbrain babies as much most who interpret this distinction as “mes” vs “notmes” “notmes” eventually come to encapsulate everyone that is not a single “me” at any given time and this paves the way for incredibly distasteful behavior until the species arrives at a place of such alienation and fear there is really nothing so horrible that one of them wouldnt do to the other to deal with this less than ideal state of affairs which seems suspiciously incompatible with how progressive and evolved they are by this point they set about to entertain themselves into an oblivion with politics sex ﬁnance philosophy and other games of war this they do until they are so numb and the idea of any “notme” so untenable that they are blissfully incapable of noticing theyre all dead this happens more or less on an inﬁnite loop until the end of time  something like that  imagine if you will as the album starts that youre way out in space looking at the earth and though its impossible to “fall” through space you start a free fall anyway in the direction of the bright blue marble for the next 75 minutes you plummet toward the earth losing more and more perspective on what an abstract and impermanent place our planet is how predictably we step on the same rakes slip on the same banana peels over and over again through the ages quickly becoming more and more immersed in the very messy business of being a human – the dubious privilege of being here the elusiveness of meaning true love and its habitual absence random euphoria and the inexplicable misery of others truth and its more alluring counterfeits the sophistication of answers that dont make any sense the barbarism of our appetites lucky breaks and injustice faith and ignorance crippling mindnumbing boredom and the terror of it all ending too soon before you know it youve delicately crashlanded and ﬁnd yourself lying on your back looking up at the stars if youre lucky with someone you love; even if just for a day a year a lifetime though just an hour has passed you have no recollection of what the earth looked like from the farﬂung reaches of space nor how simple it all seemed a matter of minutes ago  i know everyone doesnt feel the same about whats going on right now what for some is clearly gardenvariety violent white nationalism serving as a catchall for any number of paranoiainduced antifantasies foisted upon the poor and uneducated precisely by the ideologues bent on manufacturing voters who can be manipulated into voting against their own interests by making good and sure they remain poor and uneducated before cravenly blaming their problems largely on people bearing distinctions like race gender and sexuality so people forget everything thats good about the american experiment is to others an opportunity to wrench the country back from the inﬂuence of hypocritical corporate tyrants bent on enslaving our minds with spineless liberal rhetoric in order to justify wiping out the jobs of decent people so they can fulﬁll their fey utopian dream of an impossible global community designed to proﬁt only its architects probably banking consortiums pedophile rings and deﬁnitely the illuminati  this album does not espouse either of those views  both of those views take for granted a certain degree of sophistication or at least a knack for cooperation that im absolutely convinced humans do not possess; not to mention some kind of innate logic to the proceedings here on earth – which make a much better case for being some kind of demented joke than anything else  the terrifying reality concerning the dilemma above is everything is chaos and no one is really in control of anyone or anything  but what about the welldocumented history of humans making life a living hell for other humans since time began  there is no intellectual political or spiritual explanation that will ever satisfy anyone for longer than a moment least of all this the only explanation with any dignity the explanation that appeases both our instincts for compassion and liberation the explanation that we can either accept and move forward together or keep screaming to our respective heavens “why god why”  things are the way they are because this is how we the human race want them  this is how we want it  hold the motherfucking phone josh tillman you have said and done some stupid fucking things since weve known you but this is too much  now the liberals and the conservatives are both outraged because that is a sentiment that is so profoundly insensitive to the ways in which the other side is clearly wrong in objective ways regarding basic decency but whats the alternative were either all complicit in this purest comedy or the people who arent to blame are at war with the people who are to blame until everyone is dead simple as that  is progress possible what does it look like the conversion of everyone to our respective beliefs well weve seen how that typically goes the destruction of everyone who fails to conform thats not it the erection of institutions with the power and infrastructure to enforce a rule of law with the good of as many as possible at heart not much evidence for that panning out  what i recommend is this: we return to the vedic cycle and submit ourselves to the likelihood that many of us will end up getting eaten by bears its only natural what if instead of imbuing our expectations for the quality of our lives to include perpetual happiness dream fulﬁllment excessive painlessness existential certitude material wealth and all variety of romantic stimulation we were just grateful for every day that didnt involve getting eaten by a bear what if progress only meant literally progressing from one day to the next without getting violently dismembered by a 9foot tall 500pound grizzly  the irony here of course is that many more humans than wed like to think most of whom are not reading the interminable liner notes to a folk rock album do live in daily perpetual fear of getting killed by a mammal far more terrifying than a bear and i think you know the one to which i refer this form of mammal attack is made all the more nightmarish by virtue of the fact that the mammal in question kills purely ideologically bears kill because theyre hungry; theyre very reasonable in that way so maybe we should submit ourselves to their authority bears we can trust  bottom line is that as long as we expect to live in such a way – immune to the natural laws of this godless rock that govern everything else here – human existence will continue to be a cruel joke i fear however that it is too late for us to go back into the natural order we have no desire to return to our primal scene we like the way things are weve got sandwiches when were hungry airplanes for when we want to go somewhere social media when we want our voices to be heard by all gods creation we know that these magical conveniences come at a staggering price and that excess for the few is based on the scarcity of the many but thats why we invented the business of globalization weve already built the wall its a great great wall that goes up to the heavens and is as transparent as museum glass its a beautiful wall that winds surgically through nations cities neighborhoods and sometimes even homes it is a globe within a globe and those who live within its interior are as clueless as to whats happening on the other side as we are to whats happening right now on the far side of mars  theres only one creature that can penetrate that wall friends and it is bears bears can smash through that glass like a pitcher of sugar water through a brick wall the equalizing revolution of bear justice is coming too sooner than you think as it gets hotter and hotter theyre coming theyre coming into our neighborhoods theyre coming into our schools into our churches into our banks into our places of business into our governments into our beds  the joke is that the best we can do is keep on keeping on which weve proven ourselves pathologically adept at were going to save the planet alright and it will be a glorious sacriﬁce just like the skyman we invented showed us how  bears man,pure comedy
