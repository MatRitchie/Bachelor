 in this autumn town where the leaves can fall on either side of the garden wall we laugh all night to keep the embers glowing   some are leaping free from their moving cars stacking stones round their broken hearts waving down any wind that might come blowing   mice move out when the field is cut serpents curl when the sun comes up songbirds only end up where theyre going   some get rain and some get snow some want love and some want gold i just want to see you in the morning   dogs lay down in the evening heat fish do worse when they leave the sea songbirds only end up where theyre going   in this autumn town where the lights can change some get mercy and some get blame some get lost when they feel the river flowing   its all holy smoke and the flame dies fast we hold our hats while the days fly past cold wind comes and we wave but it keeps going   fathers sons and holy ghosts all come back or they all come close songbirds only end up where theyre going   some get hard and some go home some want flesh and some want bone i just want to see you in the morning   yeah i just want to see you in the morning,autumn town leaves
