 there is a roadway muddy and foxgloved whenever id have life enough my heart is screamin of and in a few days i would be there love whatever here thats left of me is yours just as it was   just as it was baby before the otherness came and i knew its name the drug the dark the light the flame   the highs hit the heights of my baby and its hold had the fight of my baby and the lights were as bright as my baby but your love was unmoved   tell me if somehow some of it remains how long you would wait for me and how long ive been away the shape that im in now your shape in the doorway make your good love known to me or just tell me bout your day   just as it was baby before the otherness came and i knew its name the drug the dark the light the shame   the highs hit the heights of my baby and its hold had the fight of my baby and the lights were as bright as my baby but your love was unmoved and the sights were as stark as my baby and the cold cut as sharp as my baby and the nights were as dark as my baby and half as beautiful too,as it was
 and these days with the world getting colder she spends more time sleeping over than i planned  tonight were gonna order in drinking wine and watching cnn its dark i know but then again its the brightest thing ive got   when im covered in rain rain when im covered in rain rain rain rain   from fireworks to fireplaces summer stole what fall replaces and now and now were people watching all the people people watching us right back now  standing by the missing signs at the cvs by the checkout line she puts her quiet hands in mine cause shes the brightest thing i got   oh im covered in rain oh im covered in rain oh im covered in rain     and come december lydia left she mentioned something about it being for the best and i cant say i disagree and its killing me  and now im standing facing west tracing my fingers around a silhouette i havent gotten used to yet but its the brightest thing i got   when im covered in rain,covered in rain
