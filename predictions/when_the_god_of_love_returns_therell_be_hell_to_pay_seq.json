{"source":"when the god of love returns therell be hell to pay though the world may be out of excuses i know just what i would say: let the seven trumpets sound as a locust sky grows dark but first lets take you on a quick tour of your creations handiwork barely got through the prisons and stores and the pale horse looks a little sick says jesus you didnt leave a whole lot for me if this isnt hell already then tell me what the hell is   and we say its just human human nature this place is savage and unjust we crawled out of the darkness and endured your impatience were more than willing to adjust and now youve got the gall to judge us   the spider spins his web the tiger stalks his prey and we steal fire from the heavens to try to keep the night at bay every monster has a code one that steadies the shaking hand and hes determined to accrue more capital by whatever means he can   oh its just human human nature weve got these appetites to serve you must not know the first thing about human beings were the earths most soulful predator try something less ambitious the next time you get bored oh my lord   we just want light in the dark some warmth in the cold and to make something out of nothing sounds like someone else i know"}
