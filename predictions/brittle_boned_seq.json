{"source":" the low electric glow â€“ static snows in the lobby dull tv magazines waiting rooms cant hide me from the sting paper sheets bloodwork and the iv and the whirring machines while the nurses reassure me: this will be quick and easy im not gonna feel a thing lie and say itll be alright like a stray falling asleep cause im so good at hurting myself  pulse is slow faint metronome on my left side beneath my protruding spine you can hardly hear at night white flag blindfold covering my sunken eyes and a line of rifles aimed at my sick mind  cause im so good at hurting myself"}
