{"lyric": "all of my friends live in a plastic bag walking around jumping the train tracks over the fence veins all black sleep on a bench in the park on my birthday call the blue lights cursed your name when i find im still awake  give me everything good and ill throw it away i wish i could quit but i cant stand the shakes choking to smoke or singing your praise but i think theres a god and he hears either way when i rejoice and complain i never know what to say  but i think theres a god and he hears either way when i rejoice and complain lift my voice that i was made and somebodys listening at night with the ghosts of my friends when i pray asking why did you let them leave and then make me stay know my name and all of my hideous mistakes  i rejoice i rejoice i rejoice i
