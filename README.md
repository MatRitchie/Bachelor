# Bachelor
This repository contains the code for a bachelor project, which aims to predict the title of a song, where the title is not present in the lyric. Throughout the project the library of Allennlp has been used (Gardner et al., 2017).
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle  (Saha, n.d.)
